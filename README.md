# hydra_gui

This is a Python script that creates a GUI using the Tkinter module for launching a brute-force attack using Hydra. The user can enter the target IP address, username, and select the type of attack from a dropdown menu. The wordlist is selected using a file dialog box. Once the user clicks on the "Start Bruteforce" button, the script executes the Hydra command based on the attack type selected by the user.
